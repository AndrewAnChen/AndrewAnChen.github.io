Abstract To acquire larger samples for answering complex questions in neuroscience, researchers have increasingly turned to multi-site neuroimaging studies. However, these studies are hindered by differences in images acquired across multiple sites. These effects have been shown to bias comparison between sites, mask biologically meaningful associations, and even introduce spurious associations.</description>

      <description>Harmonizing Functional Connectivity Reduces Scanner Effects in Community Detection Keywords Harmonization; Functional connectivity; Site effects; Community detection; Brain networks; Network analyses
Abstract Community detection on graphs constructed from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has led to important insights into brain functional organization. Large studies of brain community structure often include images acquired on multiple scanners across different studies. Differences in scanner can introduce variability into the downstream results, and these differences are often referred to as scanner effects.</description>
